I'm an India based data engineer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating the daily pipelines.

My daily task is to collect,process,analyse/load and present data - from supporting every day business decisions to fueling global change

Currently working as a Cloud Data Consultant at [EY](https://www.ey.com/).

Outside work, I occasionally write books. Off-screen, I love to play Ukelele or create some music beats!
